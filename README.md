# RTK_GPS
A RTK GPS sensor Board for drones based around the Quectel LC29H Chip. It should offer accuracy of up to 5cm. It needs a Basestation or (depending on your country) position correcting GPS data that is send to the esp32.
I made the project because I wanted to develop a drone and needed high precission and noticed that any available solutions are insanly expensive, so I came up with my own design.
